- Follow Next.js 16 best practices
- Use server components when possible, client components only when needed for interactivity

## GitHub Integration

- Use Octokit.js for all GitHub API interactions
- Store GitHub OAuth tokens in localStorage (client-side)
- Use server actions or server components to make authenticated GitHub API calls
